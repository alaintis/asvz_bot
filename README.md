# ASVZ Auto-Register Bot

This is a Python script using Selenium that automates the login and registration process for ETH Zurich students on the [ASVZ (Academic Sports Association Zurich)](https://www.asvz.ch/) platform.

## 🚀 Features

- Automates login via ETH Zurich AAI credentials
- Navigates to a specific ASVZ lesson page
- Waits for the registration button to be available
- Simulates human-like behavior (scrolls, clicks, delays) to bypass basic bot detection
- Automatically registers when the button becomes active
